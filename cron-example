# This example will run the script every five minutes

# I recommend running this as a user that has no login, f.ex http
# To edit http's crontab, run this command: sudo crontab -u http -e

# Make sure that the user you run the script as, has rights to execute the script
# You can test this by executing this command: sudo -u http bash /scripts/update.sh
# if that doesn't return "permission denied" or a similar error, you're good to go
